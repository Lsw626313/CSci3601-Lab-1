# CSCI 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab
### Spring 2016

## Instructions:
### Setting up the repository on GitHub:
1. Have one member of your group **fork** this repository on github
2. Have that group member add all other members of your group as **collaborators**

### Checking out your project in WebStorm:
1. In the WebStorm launch window, choose "Check out from version control", choose GitHub.
2. You will be asked to enter your GitHub login information, as well as a master password (used to store login information locally).
3. Select your repository from the drop down menu ("Git repository URL"). If your repo is not listed here, you can copy-paste this address from GitHub. 

### Committing changes to your project
As your are working on your project, you will need to preiodically commit changes that you have made.
Committing effectively means you are creating a local save of your current progress/project. Each commit records changes since the last commit, and the chain of commits represents the history of changes to your project!

> Protip: Frequent commits make everyone happy. Good commit messages keep your coworkers from silently cursing your name.

1. To commit changes from within a WebStorm project, go to "VCS" (Version Control Systems) and select "Commit Changes."
> Protip: The shortcut for committing is Ctrl + K
2. Please **Carefully review the list of changes** that WebStorm will present you with.
> Protip: Select a changed file and use the "details" dropdown to view a detailed description of what was changed in that file
3. Write a **MEANingful** commit message when prompted.
4. Click "commit" (Not "commit and push", or "create patch" !)
5. When adding, deleting, or renaming files in your project, you will have to do a couple special things. If you are unsure what to do here, please talk to Professor KK, or one of the lab assistants.
