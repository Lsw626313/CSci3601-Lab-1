# CSCI 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab
In this lab you will learn to create a simple website using HTML and CSS, following best practices
and using validated code, all while maintaining good version control.

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md) file in this repository.

## Setup Instructions:
Clone your repository to your local working environment.

On GitHub, you'll need to visit the *settings* for your repository and change the *GitHub Pages*
settings. Under the "Source" section, you'll need to select the branch ``master``, and save your
settings. 

> Doing this will 'host' your website, specifically the version that is on
> your ``master`` branch. This means that everything you push to ``master``
> will, in a sense, be 'published' - hence it is important that you practice
> responsible version control and only push completed features to your ``master``
> branch.

## "Running" your project
To view your website, you should be able to simply open the ``index.html`` file in your browser of choice.
(In most cases, 'double clicking' the file should do this)

#### Version Control Reminder:
Remember to practice good version control! New features should be developed in
feature branches, [commit messages should be in the present tense and provide
meaningful information](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), 
and you should use pull requests on github to merge
changes from feature branches into your master branch.
