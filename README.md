# CSCI 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab
In this lab you will learn to create a simple website using HTML and CSS, following best practices
and using validated code, all while maintaining good version control using WebStorm's git/GitHub integreation.  

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md) file in this repository.

## Setup Instructions:
### Setting up the repository on GitHub:
1. Have one member of your group **fork** this repository on GitHub
2. Have that group member add all other members of your group as **collaborators**

### Checking out your project in WebStorm:
1. In the WebStorm launch window, choose "Check out from version control", choose GitHub.
2. You will be asked to enter your GitHub login information, as well as a master password (used to store login information locally).
3. Select your repository from the drop down menu ("Git repository URL"). If your repo is not listed here, you can copy-paste this address from GitHub.
