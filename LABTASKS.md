# Lab Tasks
## Summary
Your task for this lab is to develop a static web page for a small business, such as a health food store, using HTML and CSS. Do not use any javascript. You may include forms if you'd like, but no form handling at this point.

All of the formatting (including the positioning of elements in the page) must be done using CSS. Do not include width, height, fonts, colors, etc into your HTML. Do not use absolute settings for sizes, make them relative to your page size and your default font. You are required to use some HTML5 and may use CSS3 features. If a feature is not supported in some browsers, please clearly indicate which browsers support it and which ones don't. 

## Technical Requirments:
Please read carefully the list of technical requirements below and follow it precisely.

  - Your page must use *external CSS file*. You may, if needed, use inline CSS for more specific settings, but make sure to explain (in comments) why it's needed.
  - Your HTML and *CSS must validate*, except perhaps warnings about features not supported in all browsers.
  - Your page must look reasonably well and be easy enough to navigate: there should be no fonts that are hard to read, links that are hard to see, or unpleasant color combinations. While I will not be evaluating your design per se, I may take points off for features that make a problematic user experience.
  - Your *page must look reasonably in all standard browsers* (recent Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) and preserve its setup when the window is resized.
  - Your page must have the following elements implemented as div elements (do not use tables for formatting; use CSS positioning, see the links above):
    - A *navigation bar.* It must be a fixed percentage of the page and resize with the window. It may be horizontal or vertical.
    - A *footer* with the company's address, contact information, etc.
    - At least one more div for the main part of the page. Typically each div is marked with its own id, for CSS formatting. 
  - At least *three images*. Since we don't have a real business to develop the page for, just use any images as a mock-up. Make sure you are following the copyright. The quality of the images is not a part of the grade.
  - You must use at least two ids and at least one class in your design.
  - You must use at least 12 elements in your page. List items of the same list count as one element for this purpose.
  - You must use at least 10 CSS rules in your CSS file (a rule is a selector followed by settings for this selector).
  - In your CSS you must use each of the following: grouping, nesting, a class, and an id.
  - You must use at least two and no more than five HTML5 features.
  - You may use *no more than three CSS3 features.*
